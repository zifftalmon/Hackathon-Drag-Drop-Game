Hello Ziff this is the Hackaton feedback.

The game was simple I liked and the implementation of events listener on it. Very good implementation of the array and objects methods to.
the styling on the page was also accurate with the subject. Well done using the drag and drop events to.
Also you use DOM manipulation very well. 
Congratulations on your project keep working hard.
